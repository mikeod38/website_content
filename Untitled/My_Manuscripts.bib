	abstract = {Animals coexist in commensal, pathogenic or mutualistic relationships with complex communities of diverse organisms including microbes. Some bacteria produce bioactive neurotransmitters which have been proposed to modulate host nervous system activity and behaviors. However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain modulation and its physiological relevance is largely unknown. Here we show that in
            C. elegans
            , the neuromodulator tyramine (TA) produced by gut-colonizing commensal
            Providencia
            bacteria can bypass the requirement for host TA biosynthesis to manipulate a host sensory decision. Bacterially-produced TA is likely converted to octopamine (OA) by the host tyramine beta-hydroxylase enzyme. OA, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 receptor on the ASH/ASI sensory neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory response. We identify genes required for TA biosynthesis in
            Providencia
            , and show that these genes are necessary for modulation of host behavior. We further find that
            C. elegans
            colonized by
            Providencia
            preferentially select these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection bias requires bacterially-produced TA. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter produced by gut microbiota mimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision, thereby promoting fitness of both host and microbe.},
