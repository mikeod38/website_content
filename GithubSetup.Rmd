```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

 This is a reminder of how to setup the website via github. Basically you need to have one repo for the version control for the code - in this case 'website-content' and another for the public/ folder that will host the deployed site info. That means having a .gitignore which contains public/. You can then commit files to 'website-content' while ignoring all of the content in public/. The public folder is created by blogdown and Hugo when you run `r eval=FALSE blogdown::serve_site()`

To knit this Rmd file, change `options(blogdown.allow_knit = TRUE)`, then change back to keep blogdown running correctly
