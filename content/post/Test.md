I am a postdoc researcher at [Brandeis University] (https://www.brandeis.edu) in the laboratory of [Dr. Piali Sengupta.] (http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/senguptalab/) Our lab studies the [structure] (http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_ciliumbiogenesis.2/ciliumbiogenesis.html) and [function] (http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_chemosensation/chemosensation.html) of the neuronal sensory aparatus in the roundworm, *C. elegans*. This nematode offers a unique system to study sensory biology, owing to its fully-identified [cell lineage] (http://www.wormatlas.org/celllineages.html) (consisting of 302 invariant neurons), its place as the only animal with a complete [neuronal connectivity map,] (http://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html) as well as its powerful genetic toolkit. In my work, I am leveraging these tools to study how sensory biology is modulated by environmental influences, both outside and inside the worm. In particular, I am currently focused on the role of interspecies chemical signals from microbes on sensory biology and behavior in the worm.
